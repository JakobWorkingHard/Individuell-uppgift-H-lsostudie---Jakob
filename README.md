# 📜 Introduction
This project constitutes a mandatory component of the curriculum for the Data Scientist program. The core objective of the assignment was to conduct a comprehensive exploratory data analysis on a dataset comprising 800 data points across 8 distinct variables. The primary goal of this analysis was to identify underlying trends, correlations, and significant patterns within the observed data.

# Table of Contents
* Descriptive statistics and multiple visualizations;
* Simulations (incl. probabilities and confidence intervals);
* Hypothesis testing and power analysis;
* Object-oriented structure (classes and modules);
* Linear Regression (simple and multiple)
* PCA (principal component analysis) and PCR (principal component regression)

The dataset is located in `data/health_study_dataset.csv`.
