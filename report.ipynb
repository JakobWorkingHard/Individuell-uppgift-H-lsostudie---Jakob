However, to make things even clearer we can also use linear regression, to make a linear function within our graph that tries to be as close to as many datapoints are possible ( https://www.britannica.com/topic/linear-regression ) which can then be used to make predictions. However, it must be noted that linear regression does not check for any statistical significance, and this is a great example of that, that despite us having only 47 datapoints, it draws the linear function anyway.
